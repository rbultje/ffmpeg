vp9:
- inter mode loopfilter deltas, inter skip loopfilter handling
- try to replace the ugly ref frame context (for bitstream parsing) with
  some kind of LUT
- sub8x8 mv/mode parsing and sub8x8 y inter pred
- inter itxfm_add
- inter uv pred/itxfm_add
- prefetch magic
- remove all memsets in context setting (above/left) and replace with faster
  versions that understand we're only ever writing 1,2,4,8,16 bytes. I don't
  know if these work (context-wise) without clipping to visible image size,
  though.
- likewise, use faster variants in intra pred preparation code
- add "pass" argument to itxfm 1d functions in vp9dsp.c, so we can remove
  the hack in iwht4_1d
- transpose coefficients during reading
- split coefficient reading in 2 functions, one for 32x32, one for rest
- skip coefficient parsing/adding/etc (and loopfilter) for out-of-frame area
- coefficient parsing dc contextualization using surrounding eob>0 is slow
  and can be done in a single step
- fix overhangs (e.g. if a block is 32pixels out of visible frame area, and
  we're not using edges in allocation, then we overwrite the start of the
  next line)
- intra_recon alignment for a_buf
- lossless (itxfm_add is called wrongly)
- emu_edge in inter prediction
- replace loopfilter masking logic with uint64_t LUTs
- merge bl/bp arguments? basically bs=bl*3+bp
- invert BL_NxN order?
- maybe add itxfm_add_blk variants for inter (to do multiple 4x4 per time)
- add eob arguments to itxfm_add functions so we can optimize for low eob
- x86 simd
- frame/tile mt
- scalable/resolution changing
- fix all failing fate tests (and remove -frames:v 1 argument to ensure it
  tests inter frames also)
